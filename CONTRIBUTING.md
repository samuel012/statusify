# Contributing

At Statusify, contributions are always welcome. We're open to all sorts of changes, big or small, as long as they affect the project positively. Statusify is built by people like *you*, that's the beauty of open-source software.

## How to contribute?

If you have some change in mind for the project, begin by forking it. Clone it to your local machine, make the changes you want, push and *create a pull request*. We'll look into it as soon as possible, and make our best efforts to merge it. If you find a problem, just create an *issue* and it'll be resolved before you know it.

## How we branch code

We work on the `development` branch, and merge to the `master` branch once we're sure that the code is fit to run in production. Every merge to master represents a release, and is [semantically versioned](http://semver.org/).

## Code guidelines and stuff

You should adhere to this project's styleguide, available in `.rubocop.yml`, and write tests for every new feature you introduce. You must document all code you write. That's it.
