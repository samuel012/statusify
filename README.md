# Statusify
*The status app that everyone needs.*

This is Statusify, a web application status reporting app that is written in Ruby. It aspires to be fast and easy-to-use.

## The Stack
Statusify is built on Rails 5 (currently RC1, please update to a release version as soon as it's out). You need a modern version of Ruby (>= 2.2.2), PostgreSQL and a JavaScript runtime to get Statusify working on your machine.
